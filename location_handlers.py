### THIS FILE CONTAINS HANDLERS FOR YOUR LOCATIONS ###

# There are two types of location handlers:
#   * An "ENTER" HANDLER is called whenever the player enters that location.
#   * A "WHEN HERE" HANDLER is called whenever the player does anything at that location

# For either type of handler, return TRUE to bypass the other handler logic that would otherwise run
#  ...and return FALSE if you want the regular handler logic to do its thing.

# To add a new location handler, first create a function for your item
#  and then "bind" the handler to your item in the bottom section of the file.
# When you bind, make sure you choose the right Add function, depending on whether
#  you are adding an enter handler or when-here handler.

        context.events.PrintBelow("You hear a faint moan coming from the tower to the south.")
        context.events.PrintStringInNMoves("You hear that moaning sound again.", 3)
    return False

# Here is where you "bind" your item handler function to a specific item.
def Register(context):
    locations = context.locations
